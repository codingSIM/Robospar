# Robospar
Robospar is a simulation of a mini game I got introduced to at university. 
The game we were taught was on paper so I thought it would be fun to code it.

Robospar is a simple game. 
The objective is to either reach your base first or zap your oponent. 
Both players have to enter their string of moves at the same time, it 
is not turn based. 

! The players have to press 1 or 2 to enter the string of moves in the 
respective box. 

! Players can delete a move if they press the delete key, not backspace.

The moves available are: 
* F (move forward)
* R (rotate 90 degrees clockwise)
* Z (zap)

Attention: To orient yourself towards your base you need 3 rotations. 
Example: ("RRR")

# Future improvements
Robospar has just been updated with new graphics. 
A new board was added, side menu redesign and new ships. 
Next update would bring in obstacles on the board, so the game differs every time, 
and potentially make it mobile-friendly, if possible.
